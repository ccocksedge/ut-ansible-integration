# ut-Ansible-Integration
Ansible is an opensource tool that is used primarily for:  Application deployment Updates on workstations and servers Cloud provisioning Configuration management Intra-service orchestration. Ansible does not depend on agent software and has no additional security infrastructure.  Universal Controller can be integrated easily with Ansible through a Linux/Unix Universal Agent, as Ansible software can only be installed in Unix/Linux machines. So Universal Controller can manage all Ansible task execution through an intuitive user interface controlling Ansible playbook execution/host inventory details / other Ansible utility.
